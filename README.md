## What is NetSUS?

The NetBoot/SUS/LP server allows you to host an internal software update server (SUS), a NetBoot server, and a LDAP Proxy server on the same Linux system.

## Features and Capabilities

Unlike a standard SUS, the SUS hosted by the NetBoot/SUS/LP server allows you to control which updates should be installed on each computer in your organization. NetBoot/SUS/LP server also installs a web application that can be used to easily manage your NetBoot server and/or SUS.
