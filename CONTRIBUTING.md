# Conduct

We are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, ethnicity, religion, or similar personal characteristic.

On any NetSUS related communication channels, please avoid using overtly sexual nicknames or other nicknames that might detract from a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all.

Please be kind and courteous. There's no need to be mean or rude. Respect that people have differences of opinion and that every design or implementation choice carries a trade-off and numerous costs. There is seldom a right answer, merely an optimal answer given a set of values and circumstances.

Please keep unstructured critique to a minimum. If you have solid ideas you want to experiment with, make a fork and see how it works.

We will exclude you from interaction if you insult, demean or harass anyone. That is not welcome behavior. We interpret the term "harassment" as including the definition in the [Citizen Code of Conduct](http://citizencodeofconduct.org/); if you have any lack of clarity about what might be included in that concept, please read their definition. In particular, we don't tolerate behavior that excludes people in socially marginalized groups.

Likewise any spamming, trolling, flaming, baiting or other attention-stealing behavior is not welcome.

# Communication
GitHub issues are the primary way for communicating about specific proposed changes to this project.

There is a discussion board located on [JAMF Nation](https://jamfnation.jamfsoftware.com/viewProduct.html?id=180&view=discussions). You are welcome to create an account and contribute to the discussion by asking questions, discussing bugs, or answering questions you may have knowledge about.

In both contexts, please follow the conduct guidelines above. Language issues are often contentious and we'd like to keep discussion brief, civil and focused on what we're actually doing.
