# Setting Up the NetBoot Server
To set up a NetBoot server, you need a NetBoot image (.nbi folder). For more information, see the following Knowledge Base article:[Creating a NetBoot Image and Setting Up a NetBoot Server](https://jamfnation.jamfsoftware.com/article.html?id=307)

1. Log in to the NetBoot/SUS/LP server web application.2. Click **NetBoot Server**.On a smartphone, this option is in the pop-up menu.3. Upload a NetBoot image:	* Click **Upload NetBoot Image**.

		```
		NEED IMAGE HERE
		```		You will be connected to the SMB share where NetBoot images are stored.	* Enter credentials for the SMB share and click **Connect**.	* Copy a NetBoot image (.nbi) to the SMB share.

		**Important:** The name of the folder cannot contain any spaces.4. Return to the NetBoot/SUS/LP server web application and refresh the page.5. Choose the NetBoot image from the pop-up menu.6. Choose subnets for the NetBoot image by entering a subnet and a netmask. Then click **Add Subnet**. 

	**Important**: One of the subnets must include the IP address of the NetBoot server.7. Click **Enable NetBoot**. If NetBoot is successfully enabled, the NetBoot status icon turns green.

## Using the NetBoot Server with the Casper Suite**Note**: The instructions in this section are for the Casper Suite v9.0 or later. However, if you are using the Casper Suite v8.x, these instructions can still be followed loosely.
Like standard NetBoot servers, you can add the NetBoot server hosted by the NetBoot/SUS/LP server to the JSS. This allows you to use a policy or Casper Remote to boot managed computers to a NetBoot image.
When adding the NetBoot server to the JSS, enter the IP address specified in the NetBoot/SUS/LP server web application and choose the “Use default image” option from the NetBoot Image pop-up menu.
For more information on adding a NetBoot server to the JSS, see the “NetBoot Servers” section in the Casper Suite Administrator’s Guide.
